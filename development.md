# Installing PROS w/Atom for Development (on Windows)

These instructions are designed for Windows, but generally would be the same for most operating
systems barring their methods of installing programs.

These instructions also serve as a guide for installing a "release" version of PROS w/Atom except
developer options wouldn't be used.

## Prerequisites
 - Atom
 - clang
 - Python 3.5 (development only when frozen applications are available)
 - PROS Toolchain (arm-none-eabi GCC, automake)
 - Git (development only)
